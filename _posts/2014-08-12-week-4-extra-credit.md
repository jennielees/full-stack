### Weather APIs

* Can you write a function that answers the question: "Do I need an umbrella tomorrow morning?"

### Other APIs

* Using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories):
  * print out a user's repositories given their username
  * print a summary of the unique languages used in their repositories
  * print a summary of the percentage of each language they used
  * figure out which language is most used and print out a sentence saying '_username_ is an awesome _language_name_ developer!'
  * use a list of adjectives to make that sentence more random and interesting

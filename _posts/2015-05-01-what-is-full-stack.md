#### Our Stack

The layers of the stack we will be looking at are:

* Presentation
* Client-side logic
* Template (View)
* Controller
* Model
* Database
* Web Server
* Host Machine

* How do these layers of the stack relate to the Pinterest app demonstrated in class?
* Pick an app from this list, or another app that you're familiar with. Can you identify where it might use each component in the stack?
  * Twitter
  * The New York Times
  * Google Maps
  * Amazon.com
* How do you think mobile development fits into this stack?

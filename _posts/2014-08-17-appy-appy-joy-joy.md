### Review and Refresh

We have covered a **lot** so let's take a little time to dig in and review. We will talk through  this in class.

#### Think like a Computer Scientist

Each of these pages provides a different, sometimes deeper look at some of the things we've encountered so far. You can run code right in the browser to see what's going on, and sometimes you will have a "CodeLens" option to get a step by step view.

Some pages have videos; these are optional. If you start reading the page and it doesn't make sense, try watching the video!

#### Fix My Code

Go to the [Oh No! Broken Code!](https://github.com/jennielees/oh-no-broken-code) GitHub repo and follow the instructions in the README on that page.

Try to fix the code to do what it asks (or improve it even further!)

### Back to Apps

We're going back to our Twitter/APIs app development for the remainder of this week!

If you didn't get through [the main exercise](http://labs.bewd.co/a-restful-interlude/) yet, go back to that.

Otherwise, look at the [extensions](http://labs.bewd.co/whats-in-an-api/) or [Extra Credit](http://labs.bewd.co/week-6-extra) exercises.

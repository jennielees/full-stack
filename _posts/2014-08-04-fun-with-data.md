* Revisit the street sweeping CSV
* Finding your street name (or a street you like)
  * What day of the week is my street swept?
  * What week of the month?

* Getting input (street name)
  * A little about parameters
  * argparse and argv?

* Hello, datetime!
* Which streets will be swept tomorrow?

(Revisit later, with SMS reminders)

Content coming soon. :) (Guest lecturer!)

If you arrive at class early, keep working on Tuesday's app. The goal is for you to at least complete the models file so that the next round of stuff makes sense!

We will be learning about Python classes and objects, so that we can switch to using objects instead of SQL statements, rows, and `[0]` notation! Awesome!

For the second class in Week 5, continue to work on the "Extending the App" challenges from the previous lab. Ideally, make sure you have worked through at least one challenge that involves changing the model somehow, and another that involves template changes.

## Connecting Models

How do we relate models to each other?

Remember the "foreign key" from our SQL exercises? Any SQL table can have a field that relates to the ID of a different table. Then we can just query the other table by ID to connect the dots.

We're going to add a `User` model and link it to desserts. Each dessert was submitted by a User, so we add a `user_id` field to Dessert, and make sure our `User` has an `id`. A simplified version of our tables looks like this:

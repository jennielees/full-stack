title: What's in an API?
week: 5

### Over to You

The remainder of this week is on a mini API app using the three APIs we've encountered so far. Using the twitter/weather app as a base, think of a new use case and create an app for it.

One suggestion would be to take the street sweeping functions you created earlier and copy the weather pattern: if a user tweets a street name and number, tweet back something about when it is swept.

You can also look at the Twilio docs to do this via text, instead of Twitter.

Other options include:

* JokeBot that tells a random joke when asked via Twitter
* JokeBot that tells a random joke whenever the script is run
* GrogBot that takes the pirate drink app and makes it Twitter or SMS-aware
* GrogBot that looks at the weather and suggests an appropriate drink

At the end of this week, make sure your code is in GitHub and email the instructor with your repo URL so we can give you feedback!

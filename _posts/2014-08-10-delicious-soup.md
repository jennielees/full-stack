#### Beautiful Soup

"You didn't write that awful page. You're just trying to get some data out of it."

[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Lewis Carroll-inspired screen scraping library.

[Intro to Beautiful Soup](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) is a beautiful guide, so we won't re-tread its ground here.

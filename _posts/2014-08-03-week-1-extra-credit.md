#### Extra Credit

* Write a script to calculate your remaining MUNI rides given your Clipper balance as input.

* Figure out (or remember) how to make and remove directories on the command line.

* Work through [The Way of the Program](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/introduction.html).
  * Review questions: 
    * What is a programming language?
    * What is an algorithm?
    * What is a function?
    * What is debugging?
    * What's the difference between a syntax error and a semantic error?

* Expand the superhero name generator to avoid certain names, using `if`. For example, to reject names like 'Poison Poison'. Hint: the `==` operator is used to test if two things are the same:

```
if thing_one == thing_two:
    print "The things are the same things."
```
* Use the adjective lists to make your superhero name generator even more ridiculous. You'll need to read in a new [file](python-codelabs/public/data/heroes.txt) (or [two](python-codelabs/public/data/villains.txt)) to do it. Hint: adding `.title()` after a variable name makes it Title Case, e.g. `name.title()`.

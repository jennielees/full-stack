#### Exercises

Want more practice? Try the 'extra credit' section below, or work through

* [Hackbright: Conditionals: Make a guessing game](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/Exercise01)
* [Hackbright: Math and Functions](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/Exercise02)

Both of these point to some resources you can work through first, though we've already covered some of that material, so try reading through the exercise first and going to the extra resources if you need them.


#### Extra Credit

* Write a script to calculate your remaining MUNI rides given your Clipper balance as input.

* Figure out (or remember) how to make and remove directories on the command line.

* Work through [The Way of the Program](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/introduction.html).
  * Review questions:
    * What is a programming language?
    * What is an algorithm?
    * What is a function?
    * What is debugging?
    * What's the difference between a syntax error and a semantic error?

More superheroes!

* Extend the superhero name generator: can you create your own generator for something different?

* Write ten random superhero names to a file called 'mysuperheroes.txt', making sure each name is on a new line. (Hint: `\n` is the special newline character.)

* Extend this to make sure you don't use any prefix or suffix more than once.

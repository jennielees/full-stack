### More on Functions

[Hackbright: Homework 3](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Homework/tree/master/Homework03)

In this homework, you have to take someone else's code and rewrite it.

[Hackbright: Skills 1](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/skills1): Writing individual functions practice, using lists.

[Hackbright: Skills 2](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/skills2): More function practice, these are harder.

### Older and Wiser

Go back to a previous week's exercises. Go through them again, or attempt something from the extra credit section.

Did you understand something you didn't get the first time round? Solve a problem you couldn't quite solve before?

Take this exercise and extend it by doing something the exercise doesn't ask for.

### Other APIs

* Using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories):
  * print out a user's repositories given their username
  * print a summary of the unique languages used in their repositories
  * print a summary of the percentage of each language they used
  * figure out which language is most used and print out a sentence saying '_username_ is an awesome _language_name_ developer!'
  * use a list of adjectives to make that sentence more random and interesting
   
* Using the Twitter API:
  * set up a new account that people can @-mention with a phrase, like
    _@hackeroracle what's my score? github jennielees_
  * use the Twitter API to check @-mentions on this account and try to pull out the GitHub username from it - you can assume a fairly strict adherence to the above format
  * once you have the username, use the GitHub functions you wrote above to create a reply tweet to the original user, with a nice sentence about how great a developer they are!
  * think about issues with this: how do you make sure you don't send the same tweet twice?

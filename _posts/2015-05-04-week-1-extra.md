The "Extra Resources" section for each week is a set of useful links and references that accompany the material for each week. You'll also find some "more practice" and "challenge" material in here. These are **optional**, but recommended if you want to get more facetime with the material. If you want feedback on your solutions to any of these problems, submit by email.

#### Resources

New to Python? Start here:

#### More Practice

* [Hackbright: Conditionals: Make a guessing game](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/Exercise01)
* [Hackbright: Math and Functions](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/Exercise02)

Both of these point to some resources you can work through first, so try reading through the exercise first and going to the extra resources if you need them.


#### Challenges

* Write a script to calculate the number of MUNI rides you can take, given your Clipper balance as input.

* Figure out (or remember) how to make and remove directories on the command line.

* Work through [The Way of the Program](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/introduction.html).
  * Review questions:
    * What is a programming language?
    * What is an algorithm?
    * What is a function?
    * What is debugging?
    * What's the difference between a syntax error and a semantic error?

More superheroes!

* Extend the superhero name generator: can you create your own generator for something different?

* Write ten random superhero names to a file called 'mysuperheroes.txt', making sure each name is on a new line. (Hint: `\n` is the special newline character.)

* Extend this to make sure you don't use any prefix or suffix more than once.

It's project time!

Work with the instructor(s) and TA to flesh out a project that can be completed in 4 class sessions. The final class will include a demo spot, so be prepared for that (it doesn't have to be completely finished but should be demo-able!).

If you don't have a solid project idea, try thinking about an app that would help people learning Python. Some ideas:

* A code snippet repository
* Flashcards
* Quiz with "you got it correct" answer checking
* A game that gives you extra points for doing Python practice every day

Good luck!

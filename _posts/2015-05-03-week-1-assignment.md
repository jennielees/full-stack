### How to submit assignments

We'll be submitting assignments via GitHub. This will be demonstrated in class -- check back here afterwards.

#### Assignment

Fork the [Oh No, Broken Code](http://github.com/jennielees/oh-no-broken-code/) repository. Fix as many of the files as you can and submit a pull request with your changes. (You might spot that this was part of the pre-work -- if you've already done it, please submit anyway!)

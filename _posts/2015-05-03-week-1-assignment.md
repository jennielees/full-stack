### How to submit assignments

We'll be submitting assignments via GitHub. 

In order to submit, **fork** the assignment repository to your own GitHub account. Make the changes you need, and **push** them back to your account.

Then create a **pull request** by visiting the page for your own GitHub repository, e.g. `https://github.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/REPOSITORYNAME`. You should see a prompt to make a pull request there. If not, you can hit the tiny "Pull Request" text on the page.

#### Assignment

Fork the [Oh No, Broken Code](http://github.com/jennielees/oh-no-broken-code/) repository. Fix as many of the files as you can and submit a pull request with your changes. (You might spot that this was part of the pre-work -- if you've already done it, please submit anyway!)

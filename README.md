# Notes

This is the full-stack syllabus, created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). To edit the pages, edit `_posts`.

The site is published using GitHub Pages, on the branch `gh-pages`.


## To run locally

Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) and Jekyll.

You probably probably already have the first two so try:

```
gem install jekyll
```

If that fails, back off and install the others.

To run the site:

```
jekyll serve
```

To deploy to Github:

Push to your own Github repo on the `gh-pages` branch. The site is then available at http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/YOURREPONAME/ eg [http://jennielees.github.io/full-stack](http://jennielees.github.io/full-stack).

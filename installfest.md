### Sign up for GitHub at [github.com](http://github.com/)

(GitHub is a cloud source code management place of awesome, and we'll be using it throughout the course to save and share our code.)

### Install `git`

To check if you have it already installed, type `git` into a terminal.

  * Download and Set up Git:
    * For Windows: you can install [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/) - this should also install a program called Git Bash
    * For Mac: download the latest version of [Git](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) directly, or download [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) and [install from there](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac).
    * For Linux: `apt-get install git` ([or equivalent](http://git-scm.com/download/linux)) ;)
    * Optional: Save your GitHub [account authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git) to save retyping your GitHub credentials all the time.

### Learn about `git`
  * Work through [Try Github](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
  * Optional: You can get more practice [here](https://github.com/chriszf/Hackbright-Curriculum/tree/master/GitOperations).

### Install Python 2.7

  * Mac/Linux: This should already be installed! `\_o_/`
    * To check, open a terminal and type `python -V`
    * You should see 2.7.something
    * If not, [download from python.org](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/)
    * Mac (Optional): Install [more developer tools](https://gist.github.com/jennielees/4800ad4661a58d671b17).
  * Windows: [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/)

### Explore the Terminal and learn some basic commands.

  * Go to the [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) and work through as much of it as you can.
  * If you are on Windows, make sure you have Git Bash (see above), and then look at this ["Explore git bash"](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash) guide.
  * If you prefer games, try [this](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) too (in-browser).

### Install a text editor, if you don't already have one!

I thoroughly recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

### Test Out

If you can do the following you are all set!

  * Create a GitHub repository called something like 'python-class'
  * From the command line:
    * Create a directory
    * Initialize Git
    * Create an empty file called README.md
    * Add README.md to Git
    * Commit with a vaguely meaningful commit message
    * Push to GitHub

(README.md is a Markdown file, although an empty one. Markdown is a common format used to style text without the agony of HTML: you can learn more [over here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Though it's not going to be used in the course, you'll probably encounter .md files here and there.)
